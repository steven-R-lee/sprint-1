## Dear Mum and Dad,
## The Command Line is seemingly a mythical thing used by developers when they wish to communicate their black-box magic arts with the computer. A computer is set up with a heart, flesh and a skin. The skin is what you will see as its software programmes or 'apps', in the modern parlance. The heart is what you can think of as the core of a computer. It doesn't understand human languages - try binary or hexidecimal. The computer's flesh is its Command Line location (a.k.a. Terminal, Shell) or Prompt). A developer must travel to the computer's flesh, its Terminal, in order to speak with the computer's heart, its core. Once there, a developer can only communicate with the core of the computer by way of issuing commands in a language that it understand. This speak is via a Command Line vocabulary . Commands that might not necessarily make sense to us humans but makes sense to the core, without going the full distance and breaking into fluent computer-speak - binary or hexidecimal.

### Here are 10 teerminal commands:
#1. 'ls' to list all files and folders.
#2. 'ls -al' to list all files and folders with log-format details, including those files and folders that might be hidden.
#3. 'pwd' to print the working directory in which you are currently located.
#4. 'mkdir' to make a new directory within the directory which you are currently located. 
#5. 'cat <filename>' to show the content of the file named <filename>.
#6. 'man <command>' is a useful comman for people like me who can remember the command but forget what they do - an online help.
#7. 'rm <filename>' to delete that file named <filename> which you didn't want anyone to see.
#8. 'touch <filename>' to create a new file named <filename>.
#9. 'kill' to stop that process which the computer is running and which you no longer want it to run.  It happens often!
#10. 'CTRL+D' is a basic terminal shortcut that means logout - my favourite.
